    <h1 align="center">Configuring Airspy devices for ka9q-radio</h1>
    <h1 align="center">v1.0</h1>
    <h1 align="center">Phil Karn, KA9Q, May 2022</h1>
    <br>
    The configuration file <i>/etc/radio/airspyd.conf</i> (and/or any
    files under <i>/etc/radio/airspyd.conf.d</i>) specify your Airspy
    R2, Airspy Mini and Airspy HF+ SDR front end devices to the <b>ka9q-radio</b>
    package. The Airspy R2 and Airspy Mini use the <b>airspyd </b>daemon

    and the AIrspy HF+ uses <b>airspyhfd </b>but all device types and
    both daemons use the same configuration file(s).<br>
    <br>
    They are in 'ini' format with one section for each device. Here's
    one from my own station, which you will need to edit for your use:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>[2m]
description = "2m vertical"
serial = 91d064dc27839fcf
iface = eth0	           ; force primary interface, avoid wifi
status = 2m-vertical.local
data = 2m-vertical-data.local
linearity = 1              ; default is off<br></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The section name [2m] will become the name of the instance of <b>airspyd</b><i>
      </i>(or <b>airspyhfd</b>) handling it. Each section describes one
      Airspy device; you can have as many as you want, limited only by
      your system USB capacity. (The Airspy R2 generates 240 Mb/s, but
      it's a USB 2.0 -- not 3.0 -- device so each will have to be on its
      own USB host controller.)<br>
    </p>
    As with any Linux system daemon, once configured you may enable it
    to start automatically on the next reboot with<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable airspyd@2m</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    You may also start (or stop, or restart) it immediately with the
    commands<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>$ sudo systemctl start airspyd@2m</pre>
      <pre>$ sudo systemctl stop airspyd@2m</pre>
      <pre>$ sudo systemctl restart airspyd@2m</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These manipulate the systemd service files
      /etc/systemd/system/airspyd@.service and
      /etc/systemd/system/airspyhfd@.service. By default they will retry
      every 5 seconds indefinitely to restart a failed daemon until
      manually stopped (i.e., with systemctl stop). For this reason the
      daemons themselves generally exit on error (e.g, if the device is
      unplugged from the USB) rather than attempt to recover.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Use the systemctl status command to display the status of an <i>airspyd</i>
      or <i>airspyhfd</i> instance:<br>
    </p>

    The supported entries in each section are as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>description</b> </i>Optional. Gives free-format text that
    will be carried through the <b>radiod</b> program to the
    control/status stream and the <b>control</b><b> </b>program that
    listens to it. It will also be advertised in DNS SRV (service
    discovery) records by the Linux mDNS daemon <b>avahi</b>, so keep
    it short but descriptive.<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>serial</i></b> <u>Required</u>. This must exactly match the
    Airspy R2 64-bit serial number, in hex (the leading 0x is optional).
    This can be read with the <b>airspy_info</b> utility in the <i>airspy</i>
    Debian package:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>$ airspy_info<br>airspy_lib_version: 1.0.9<br>Found AirSpy board 1<br>Board ID Number: 0 (AIRSPY)<br>Firmware Version: AirSpy NOS v1.0.0-rc10-6-g4008185 2020-05-08<br>Part ID Number: 0x6906002B 0x00000030<br>Serial Number: 0x91D064DC27839FCF<br>Supported sample rates:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.000000 MSPS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.500000 MSPS<br>Close board 1</pre>
    <br>
    Note that <b>airspy_info</b> will not see the device when any other
    program (including <b>airspyd</b>) has it open. Any Airspy devices
    without an entry with a matching serial number are ignored. If an
    instance is started for a non-existent device the daemon will exit
    and the Linux system will continually restart it every 5 seconds
    until the device appears.<br>
    <br>
    I found it very helpful to label each of my Airspy devices with
    their serial numbers.<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>iface</i></b> Optional, but recommended. This specifies the
    network interface to be used for all multicast network traffic from
    <b>airspyd</b> or <b>airspyhfd</b>. If not specified, the default
    Linux multicast interface will be used. <u>This may not be what you
      want!</u> Many computers, including most recent Raspberry Pis have
    both a wired Ethernet interface (usually eth0) and a WiFi interface
    (wlan0). If wlan0 comes up before eth0, which can happen if you have
    a "smart" Ethernet switch with the spanning tree protocol (STP)
    enabled, the Linux kernel may pick it as the default multicast
    interface. Since most WiFi networks handle multicast traffic poorly,
    this will probably result in lost traffic and erratic operation on
    your entire network, not just for <b>ka9q-radio</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>status</i></b> The status name is passed to <b>radiod</b>
    (the <b>ka9q-radio</b> down converter/demodulator daemon) through
    its own config file (e.g., /etc/radio/radio@foo.conf) to use the
    desired front end. Note that the names of the <b>radiod</b> and <b>airspyd</b>
    or <b>airspyhfd</b> instances need not be the same.<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>data</i></b><u> Required</u>. This specifies the domain name
    of the multicast group for the raw A/D sample stream. As with <i>status

    </i>the default suffix is ".local" and an IPv4 address in the
    239.0.0.0/8 block will be generated by hashing. Because this address
    is included in the status stream it does not need to be manually
    specified to <b>radiod</b>. A DNS PTR record of type _rtp._udp will
    be advertised.<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>linearity</i></b> Boolean, default off. Like most
    second-generation SDRs with analog tuners, the Airspy R2 has three
    stages of analog gain ahead of the A/D converters that any AGC must
    carefully manage. The airspy library provides separate gain tables
    optimized for sensitivity and for linearity (i.e. resistance to
    intermod). airspyd uses the sensitivity table by default, but in
    areas with strong signals the linearity table may provide better
    resistance to intermod. I'm about 6 km line of sight from a dozen FM
    broadcast transmitters so I use the linearity setting.<br>
    <h2>Other settings</h2>
    &nbsp;<br>
    More settings are available but the defaults are sufficient for most
    situations. Several are taken directly from calls in the airspy and
    airspyhf+ driver libraries with little documentation, so I don't
    actually know what they do. (Any details would be welcome.)<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>blocksize</b></i> Defaults for <b>airspyd</b>: 32,768 if <i><b>data-ttl</b></i><i>
    </i> = 0, 960 otherwise; defaults for <b>airspyhfd</b>: 2,048 if <i><b>data-ttl</b></i>
    = 0, 128 otherwise.<br>
    <p>Set the number of samples in each data IP packet. The defaults
      depend on <i><b>data-ttl</b></i> because the 1500 byte Ethernet
      MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit, aka packet size limit) is relevant
      only for traffic that actually has to pass through the hardware,
      and larger packets (up to the 64KB IPv4 datagram limit) are much
      more efficient when looped back in software. The Airspy R2
      produces packed 12 bit real integers, so 960 samples occupies
      1,440 bytes, leaving room for the IP, UDP and RTP headers. When
      data-ttl=0, the 32,768 samples occupy 49,152 bytes, comfortably
      within the 64KB limit while cleanly dividing (by 3) the 98,304
      sample callback buffer inside the Airspy R2 library driver to keep
      the IP packets the same size.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The Airspy HF+ produces complex floating point samples at 8 bytes
      (64 bits) each. The library callback buffer contains 2,048 samples
      (16,384 bytes) and this is used when the IP TTL is 0. The default
      blocksize is reduced to only 128 samples (1,024 bytes) when the IP
      TTL &gt; 0 to still cleanly divide the callback buffer (by 16).<br>
      <i><b><br>
          data-ttl</b></i> Default 0. Sets the Internet Protocol
      Time-to-Live field, more accurately described as a hop count
      limit. This limits the number of IP routers through which the A/D
      data packets may be routed even to hosts actively subscribing to
      it. Setting <b><i>data-ttl</i></b>=0 means that the data traffic
      never leaves the host running <b>airspyd </b>or <b>airspyhfd</b>
      but can still be received by any program (such as <b>radiod</b>)
      running on the same host. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The default is 0 because the A/D stream is a <i>lot</i> of
      traffic (240 Mb/s for the Airspy R2) and <b>radiod</b> running on
      the same computer is usually its only consumer. This also sets the
      default packet size (see <i><b>blocksize</b></i>) to a much
      larger and much more CPU-efficient value than would be necessary
      to avoid IP fragmentation if the data traffic actually had to flow
      out through the physical Ethernet interface. Set a nonzero value
      here <i>only</i> if you need to send the raw A/D stream over the
      Ethernet to another host computer, and then only if you're <i>sure</i>
      that your network can handle it. Be especially careful if you have
      a WiFi base station on your network; even modest levels of
      sustained multicast traffic will swamp a WiFi base station even if
      no client terminals are subscribed to it.<br>
      <b><i><br>
          samprate</i></b> Default for <b>airspyd</b>: 20000000 (20
      MHz). Default for <b>airspyhfd</b>: 912000 (912 kHz). Set the A/D
      sample rate. Only certain rates are supported by the hardware;
      they are listed at startup. The default is the maximum for each
      device.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b><i>status-ttl</i></b> Default 1. Sets the Internet Protocol
      Time-to-Live (hop count limit) field for status traffic. The
      default is 1 because the control program needs it and there is far
      less of it than A/D data, so check this setting if it is getting
      status responses from <b>radiod</b> but not <b>airspyd </b>or <b>airspyhfd</b>.
      Note that <b><i>status-ttl</i></b>=1 will keep this traffic from
      passing through any multicast routers, but the most likely use
      case for the <b>ka9q-radio</b> package is on a single LAN. (Smart
      Ethernet switches are not routers, so they always pass multicast
      traffic to any port that subscribes to it.)<br>
    </p>
    <p><i><b>ssrc</b></i> Default: derived from the time of day. Sets
      the 32-bit Real Time Protocol (RTP) Stream Source identifier in
      the data stream. This normally does not have to be set, as radiod
      and other consumers automatically accept whatever SSRC is used.<br>
    </p>
    <b><i>tos</i></b> Default: 48 (decimal). Sets the IP Type of Service
    header byte, interpreted by many smart Ethernet switches (and
    routers) as a priority or queue selector. The default value of 48
    corresponds to DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) AF12, which
    is one level above "routine" traffic. This should not need to be
    changed as you should engineer your LAN to have sufficient capacity
    to carry all this traffic, and then priorities don't matter. However
    this field might come in handy in configuring your switches to avoid
    being jammed by multicast traffic should it flow by mistake
    somewhere it shouldn't (e.g., a 10 Mb/s switch port).<br>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Airspyd-only options</h2>
    <i><b>agc-high-threshold</b></i> Default -10 dBFS. Set the average
    A/D output level at which the the software AGC will decrease the
    front end analog gain by one step.<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>agc-low-threshold</b></i> Default -40 dBFS. Set the average
    A/D output level at which the software AGC will increase the front
    end analog gain by one step. <br>
    <br>
    <i><b>bias</b></i> Boolean, default off. Enable the bias tee
    (preamplifier power).<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>lna-agc</i></b> Boolean, default off. Enable the hardware LNA
    AGC and disable the software AGC. Doesn't seem to keep proper gain
    distribution, i.e., poor sensitivity and/or excessive
    intermodulation products seem to result. Use the default (software
    AGC) instead.<br>
    <br>
    <i><b>mixer-agc</b></i> Boolean, default off. Enable the hardware
    mixer AGC and disable the software AGC. Doesn't seem to keep proper
    gain distribution, i.e., poor sensitivity and/or excessive
    intermodulation products seem to result. Use the default (software
    AGC) instead.<br>
    <br>
    <i>l</i><i><b>na-gain, mixer-gain, vga-gain</b></i> Integers,
    defaults unset. Manually set fixed gains for the LNA, mixer and
    variable gain (baseband) amplifier stages. The units are supposed to
    be in decibels but don't seem well calibrated. Use the software AGC
    instead.<br>
    <br>
    <b><i>gainstep</i></b><b> </b>Integer, 0-21 inclusive, default
    unset. Manually select an entry in the airspy library gain table.
    The default is to select an entry automatically with a software AGC
    (in <b>airspyd</b>) based on the average A/D output level and the <i>linearity</i>
    setting.<br>
